# CNN-for-Brain-Tumor-Detection-in-MRI-with-Grad-CAM-Interpretability

This project implements a CNN-based brain tumor detection system using MRI images to support early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Unlike traditional image processing and machine learning methods that rely on handcrafted features, CNNs automatically learn robust spatial features directly from raw MRI data.

The proposed framework integrates **preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification** into a unified deep learning model. To improve **model interpretability**, **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** is used to visualize regions of the MRI that contribute most to tumor predictions, helping clinicians understand and trust the model’s decisions.

Model performance is evaluated using **accuracy and loss metrics** across multiple training epochs, demonstrating effective and explainable brain tumor detection suitable for real-world medical applications.
